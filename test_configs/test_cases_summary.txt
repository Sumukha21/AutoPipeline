1) Objective: Compute sum of two integers:
   Config: add_simple.yml
   Purpose:
     1) Just to check if a node is being instantiated and executed
     2) Exception handling testing (factory/function multiple paths,
      not giving params as dict)
     3) Checking if output is being printed


2) Objective: Evaluate the following expression ((c - (a + b)) + d + (a + b)):
   Note: (a, b, c, d are integers)
   Config: three_nodes_simple.yml
   Purpose:
     1) Check if the nodes are executed in the correct flow
     2) Check if output of one node is being correctly fed as input to other node
     3) Passing outputs from multiple nodes as input to a single node
     4) Exception handling (Input not given as dict, incorrect node names in inputs)
     5) Returning outputs from multiple nodes


3) Objective: Evaluate the following expressions ((c - (a + b)) + (a * b) + (a - b)), (c - (a + b) + d)
   Note: (a, b, c, d are integers)
   Config: multi_node_multi_output.yml
   Purpose:
     1) Check the execution when having multiple flows
     2) Accessing individual outputs when a node returns multiple outputs and passing
        that as input to other nodes
     3) Providing all parameters of a node through the outputs of other nodes

4) Objective: Compute sum of two lists element wise
   Config: generator_simple.yml
   Purpose:
     1) Testing dynamic inputs access (From an external source)
     2) Testing working with different batch_size values
     3) Different ways of storing outputs
     4) Providing iterators through different sources
        4.1) Both inputs from outputs of other nodes
        4.2) Both inputs from files
        4.3) One input from file, other from output of other node
     5) Reading from different types of files (csv, pckl, txt)
     6) Output from other node having different formats (dict, list)

5) Objective: Design the processing pipeline for a communication system
   Config: Encoder_Decoder.yml
   Purpose:
     1) Testing Multi level graph flows (3 levels)
     2) global outputs access (including level 1 to level3)
